                    It is a boardind school and it is said that schools shape us to become more responsible adults. We must treat our schools with respect as they are the places of worship for a student. A good student is the product of a good school. My school has excellent teachers who help students with studies, sports, and other extracurricular activities. They are the building blocks of aa school and teach us important lessons that we must apply in our daily lives. Schools teach us to cooperate with our friends and classmates. The basic value of sharing is taught right from the beginning. We have different classrooms where the teachers teach us different subjects. Equal weightage is given to both studies and co-curricular activities so that we develop into better individuals. Our schools will always try to focus on our overall growth and transform us into healthy adults.

It becomes very busy during the break times very difficult to find a seat to sit on during those times, so we have to stand and eat.
Our school canteen is very well equipped. One can buy almost every kind of snack there, like samosas, chips, sandwiches, sweet, cakes etc. They are prepared in very hygienic surroundings by our school cook, and tables to sit on and eat, and ovens to keep the food warm. There is also a soda fountain which is Very popular among the older students.
All the students love to sit in the canteen and discuss the events of the day. The noise level is always very high in the canteen as everyone is shouting to make himself heard. There are notice boards and suggestion boxes which all students are freely. There is also a separate enclosure for teachers. The cook charges very reasonable rates from us.</p>
